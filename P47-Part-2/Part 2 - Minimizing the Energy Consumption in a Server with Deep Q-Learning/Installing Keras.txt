Installing Keras
Hi guys,

Exciting news, in the next tutorial we will execute the training!

However before that make sure to install Keras on your machine. Below are the installation instructions:

Linux and Max users, please open your terminal.
On Mac, the easiest way to open it is to press anywhere cmd + space, and then in the Spotlight Search you enter "terminal".
On Linux, you will find it very easily, usually on the left side of your monitor.
Then inside the terminal, copy-paste and enter the following line command:

conda install -c conda-forge keras
And Windows users, please open the anaconda prompt, which you can find this way:
Windows Button in the lower left corner -> List of programs -> anaconda -> anaconda prompt
Then inside the anaconda prompt, copy-paste and enter the following line command:

conda install -c conda-forge keras
And enjoy the results!
