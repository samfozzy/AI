Homework Instruction
Here is the Practical Activity for this Part 2:

Training Artificial Intelligence solutions can be very costly, especially if you are training them for many servers in several data centers. 
Hence we must absolutely optimize the training time of these AIs. One solution for this is Early Stopping. It consists of stopping the training 
if the performance is not improved after a certain period of time (e.g. after a certain number of epochs). So that raises the following question:

How to assess the improvement of the performance?

There are two ways to do it:

Checking if the total reward accumulated over the full period of 5 months (= 1 training epoch) is still increasing, after a chosen number of epoch

Checking if the loss is still getting reduced, by at least a chosen percentage threshold, over the epochs

Your mission is to implement this Early Stopping technique using either 1. or 2. Then together we will implement 1.

You will get the solution in the next tutorial, but before please try hard to tackle this challenge. Practice really does make perfect.

Good luck!
